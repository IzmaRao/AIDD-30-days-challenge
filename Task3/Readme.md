# AIDD-30-days-challenge - Task 3
##🌟 PART A — Research Questions
### Q1. What new improvements were introduced in Gemini 3.0?
Gemini 3.0 is the smartest AI on the planet, and its improvements in the way it thinks, the way it deals with objects, such as text and video, and essentially behaves like your best friend, who assists you greatly. It succeeds in the harshest exams, such as scoring 1501 on LMArena in the general smarts and 81 percent on MMMU-Pro in combining types of information. And the 1-million-word memory, by the way, is absolutely huge, and it speaks much better, and it is much safer, against tricks or bad use.

### Q2. How does Gemini 3.0 improve coding & automation workflows?
Gemini 3.0 simplifies the process of coding, vibe coding in first place, transforming the casual ideas directly into the code and managing an entire task entirely on its own. It scores highest on bugs fixing on SWE-bench where it has a 76% and highest on using the tools in Terminal-Bench where it has a 54%. In the case of automation, there is little assistance necessary since it can arrange and execute lengthy tasks, such as sorting emails or creating apps step-by-step.

### Q3. How does Gemini 3.0 improve multimodal understanding?
Gemini 3.0 combines text, images, video, audio, and code in a seamless fashion, such as a workout plan the form of a video, or a photo recipe inside the form of steps. It performs well in mixed-media tests, with a 87.6% on Video-MMU in getting video smarts. This allows it to generate entertaining illustrations during search such as interactive maps in the sciences.

### Q4. Name any two developer tools introduced with Gemini 3.0.
Google Antigravity, an AI workspace that agents browse and code on your behalf, and Gemini CLI, which provides quick AI assistance when coding with a command line tool are two new tools.
